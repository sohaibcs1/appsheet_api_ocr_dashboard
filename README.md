1. Overview:

Develop a mobile application for golf enthusiasts to track their golf rounds.
The application will synchronize data with an existing web application database.
Users will have three methods to input data: manual entry, GPS data entry via integration with the GOLFBERT API, and OCR data capture.
2. User Authentication and Profile:

Users must be able to sign up, log in, and manage their profiles.
Profile information should include at least username, email, and password.
3. Data Entry Methods:

Method 1: Manual Entry:

Users can manually input shot-by-shot data including distance, lie, and penalty.
Design the interface to facilitate easy and intuitive data entry.
Method 2: GPS Data Entry via GOLFBERT API Integration:

Integrate with the GOLFBERT API to retrieve GPS data for golf course layouts.
Allow users to select the current hole they are playing.
Provide an interactive interface for users to record shot/location using GPS data.
Display the recorded data organized by shots and holes for user review and correction.
Method 3: OCR Data Capture:

Enable users to upload images of their physical scorecards.
Implement OCR algorithms to extract shot data from scorecard images.
Present extracted data to users for verification and correction.
4. Data Presentation and Correction:

Regardless of the entry method, display recorded data in an organized format for user review.
Allow users to correct any mistakes in the recorded data.
5. Data Sync with Web App Database:

Implement APIs to send data from the mobile application to the web application database.
Ensure data synchronization is secure and user-specific.
6. User Experience and Interface Design:

Design an intuitive and user-friendly interface for seamless data entry and navigation.
Ensure consistency in design across different data entry methods.
7. Platform Compatibility:

Develop the application for both iOS and Android platforms.
Ensure compatibility with a wide range of mobile devices.
8. Performance and Reliability:

Optimize application performance for smooth user experience.
Ensure reliability and stability of the application under varying network conditions.
